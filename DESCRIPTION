Description: Functional claims reserving methods based on aggregated chain-ladder data, also known as a run-off triangle, implemented in three nonparametric algorithms (PARALLAX, REACT, and MACRAME) proposed in Maciak, Mizera, and Pešta (2022) <doi:10.1017/asb.2022.4>. Additional methods including permutation bootstrap for completed run-off triangles are also provided.
