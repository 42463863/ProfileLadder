[![CRAN Version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/ProfileLadder)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ProfileLadder)

## Overview

The R package ProfileLadder provides nonparametric, functional-based methods for claims reserving based on 
aggregated chain-ladder data also known as the run-off triangles. 
The package implements three estimation/prediction algorithms (PARALLAX, REACT, and MACRAME) 
and the permutation bootstrap add-on proposed in Maciak, Mizera, and Pe≈°ta (2022). 

## Installation
