## Overview

The **R** package **ProfileLadder** provides nonparametric,
functional-based methods for claims reserving based on aggregated
chain-ladder data also known as the run-off triangles. The package
implements three estimation/prediction algorithms (PARALLAX, REACT, and
MACRAME) and the permutation bootstrap add-on proposed in Maciak,
Mizera, and Pešta (2022).

The package offers a flexible and computationally effective framework
for point-wise and distributional reserve predictions and includes
pertinent visualization and diagnostic tools through S3 methods. It also
provides accessor functions and real-world datasets to support
exploratory analysis across insurance, operational risks, and other
domains where triangular data structures arise, making modern,
transparent, and extensible alternatives to classical approaches
accessible in insurance industry and academic research.

## Installation

The **R** package **ProfileLadder** can be downloaded from CRAN and
installed in R by using

    install.packages("ProfileLadder")

## Core Functions

The key functions of the ProfileLadder package that implement three
functional-based nonparametric (point) reserve prediction algorithsms,
the overall distributional reserve prediction implemented in the
permutation bootstrap resampling, and the prediction of the next running
diagonal (so-called 1-year-ahead prediction).
